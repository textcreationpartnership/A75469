         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The firſt onſet and blow he gave him, was not by circumſtance, but downright; he denied his Supremacy and his power to be univerſall, and did limit his power only to an Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction and that alſo to extend no further then the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> and withall, he acknowledged to Kings as Gods Anointed, and his immediate Vice-geren<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

After he had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied his Country-men by diſputation, he proceeds to matter of circumſtance, and begins to cleanſe the church from their Reliques and Superſtitions. The Surplice is hung by, as of no uſe, the uſe of the Croſſe is quite croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out of the neceſſity of their Belief, the Altar is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and in fine, whatſoever might give the leaſt occaſion of offence be removed, and tooke away, being rather ſtumbling blocks, then help unto the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God.</p>

               <p>Right, then was <hi>Ephraim</hi> againſt <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and <hi>Manaſses</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim:</hi> yet were they both againſt <hi>Iudah.</hi> So though <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> in ſome ſmall circumſtances diſagreed among themſelves; yet they both laboured the extirpation of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and the ſubverſion of the <hi>Popiſh tyrannie:</hi> and what <hi>Luther</hi> by reaſon of his untimely death left unfiniſhed, <hi>Calvin</hi> did bring to perfection, thoſe <hi>ſuperſtitious Ceremonies</hi> which <hi>Luther</hi> but denied, <hi>Calvin</hi> quite took away: the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice was rent in pieces, the uſe of the Croſſe not any thought of, and the exalted State of the Altar was brought ſo low, that he left no ſign at all thereof: nay, he went ſo far in the matter of <hi>Reformation,</hi> that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the pride and Hierarchy of Biſhops, and did not deſiſt untill he had cleanſed the Church from all Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious whatſoever; for he well underſtood, that the <hi>Catholiques</hi> are like <hi>Foxes,</hi> and that where they can put in the head, they will ſoon put in the reſt of the body.</p>

               <p>This was a moſt happy <hi>Reformation,</hi> and I hope that before your departure, you will ſee the ſame in our Kingdome: that ſo we as well as you may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the tranquility and peace, both of Conſcience and Eſtate.</p>

               <p>I hope J ſhall, and then I ſhall think my Journey happily undertaken, and it will be a moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py hearing to our Brethren in our parts, to underſtand of the proſperity of this Kingdome, when it ſhall begin with the Glory of God, and the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Church.</p>

               <p>Things have bin a very long time, and yet nothing concluded of, by reaſon of the manifold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions in this Kingdome: but now I hope very ſhortly we ſhall behold a <hi>Reformation;</hi> for the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens have very much and zealouſly indeavoured the extirpation of the abuſes of the times, which have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed the peace of the Church and Common-wealth: they have bin no way defective to have the ambitious and proud <hi>Epiſcopall Hierarchy</hi> (from whom all theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills did ſpring) called to queſtion, and to be cenſured according to their deſerts, for moleſting both the peace of the Church &amp; Realm. And the Honorable Houſe now aſſembled, I doubt not, but will be ſpeedy in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to root out all <hi>Hereſies</hi> from the Church, that ſo the God of peace being honoured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Kings Maieſty obeyed, and the Common-wealth eſtabliſhed, we may have a moſt happy and flouriſhing Kingdome.</p>
